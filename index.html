        <ul>
          <bold><li>Enter your HTML notes here</li></bold>
          <li>HTML creates structure (frame), made up of elements such as Text, Image, Header and List</li>
          <li>Element types used to describe the elements: Meta-related elements, Content division elements, Semantic elements</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html - Declaration (not case sensitive) lets the browser know what to expect</li>
          <li>head element contains the Metadata for the web application or browser</li>
          <li>Metadata = data about the webpage that the browser uses to serve the page to users. Not seen by user but contains important info</li>
          <li>Lang=”en” - Attribute = tells the browser the language of the webpage</li>
          <li>ATTRIBUTES are always defined in the opening element, never the closing</li>
          <li>title element defines the title for the webpage (required/extremely important for SEO)</li>
          <li>style - element defines the CSS styles associated</li>
          <li>base elements define the base URL</li>
          <li>link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>meta element defines metadata like character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>UTF-8 - allows you to use most characters and symbols on the page</li>
          <li>HTTP-equiv - sets an HTTP header for content</li>
          <li>Viewport - sets the default view of our page</li>
          <li>script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
          <li>body - all content shown to the user</li>

          <li>p and /p - represent a paragraph block of text, MUST be opened and closed</li>
          <li>ul, ol, li - represent unordered lists and list items</li>
          <li>img - contains information about images displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>br - creates a line of empty space, or line break</li>
          <li>a - Anchor (creates link to the same webpage, or other webpages</li>
          <li>Href - points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>section - are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content and allows you to elegantly organize the content on your page</li>
          <li>id  - attribute used to identify elements and select them</li>
          <li>class - works simlarly to id</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
       <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS style sheet, and External CSS style sheet</li>
       <li>Inline CSS - When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag</li>
       <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet - This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
       <li>External CSS Style Sheet - the most common way to style a webpage - allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
       <li>CSS Rule: Begins with Selector - Selector (ex; div or *). defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
       <li>*  = a special wild card symbol used to declare that ALL the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set at 0</li>
       <li>,  = used to combine 2 selectors into a single CSS rule, allowing declarations to affect both</li>
       <li>..followed by Declaration Block(s) (ex; color, text align, etc.) contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
       <li>DRY code = (do not repeat yourself code) a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
       <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element - not visible, merely adds a buffer</li>
       <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element</li>
       <li>Img - a selector that assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>
       <li>.card selector - class selector that contains width, border, shadowline properties, etc</li>
       <li>Display: block;  - assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
       <li>ul - element that declares the font to be 20px and the padding on the left of the unordered list to be 40px</li>
       <li>link element - connects to the external file</li>
       <li>rel attribute - specifies the relationship between current document and linked document resource</li>
       <li>href attribute - specifies the location of the external source (URL). The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location</li>
     </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
      <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>High level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites; effects, interactivity, data communication, etc. JavaScript IS case sensitive</li>
       <li>Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort</li>
       <li>These include:</li>
       <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples</li>
       <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook</li>
       <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications</li>
       <li>Variables are containers that store values in our code. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:</li>
       <li>let myVariable;</li>
       <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement</li>
       <li>String - This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks</li>
       <li>Number - This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them</li>
       <li>Boolean - This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks</li>
       <li>Array - This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
       <li>Object - This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn</li>
       <li>The Null type is inhabited by exactly one value: null</li>
       <li>The Undefined type is inhabited by exactly one value: undefined</li>
       <li>Undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object</li>
       <li>EX:</li>
       <li>A return statement with no value (return;) implicitly returns undefined</li>
       <li>Accessing a nonexistent object property (obj.iDontExist) returns undefined</li>
       <li>A variable declaration without initialization (let x;) implicitly initializes the variable to undefined</li>
       <li>Many methods, such as Array.prototype.find() and Map.prototype.get(), return undefined when no element is found</li>
       <li>null is a keyword, but undefined is a normal identifier that happens to be a global property</li>
       <li>The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false</li>
       <li>The Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value. It is capable of storing positive floating-point numbers</li>
       <li>NaN ("Not a Number") is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number</li>
       <li>The String type represents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing UTF-16 code units. Each element in the string occupies a position in the string</li>
       <li>The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit</li>
       <li>A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property</li>
       <li>Objects are the only mutable values. Functions are, in fact, also objects with the additional capability of being callable</li>
       <li>Object Properties are equivalent to key-value pairs. Property keys are either strings or symbols. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures</li>
       <li>There are two types of object properties: The data property and the accessor property</li>
       <li>Data properties associate a key with a value. It can be described by the following attributes: value</li>
       <li>The value retrieved by a get access of the property. Can be any JavaScript value: writable</li>
       <li>A boolean value indicating if the property can be changed with an assignment: enumerable</li>
       <li>A boolean value indicating if the property can be enumerated by a for...in loop: configurable</li>
       <li>A boolean value indicating if the property can be deleted, can be changed to an accessor property, and can have its attributes changed</li>
       <li>Accessor property - Associates a key with one of two accessor functions (get and set) to retrieve or store a value</li>
       <li>NOTE: It's important to recognize it's accessor property — not accessor method. We can give a JavaScript object class-like accessors by using a function as a value — but that doesn't make the object a class</li>
       <li>The prototype of an object points to another object or to null — it's conceptually a hidden property of the object, commonly represented as [[Prototype]]</li>
       <li>Arrays are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property</li>
       <li>Typed Arrays present an array-like view of an underlying binary data buffer, and offer many methods that have similar semantics to the array counterparts. "Typed array" is an umbrella term for a range of data structures, including Int8Array, Float32Array, etc</li>
       <li>Keyed collections: Maps, Sets, WeakMaps, WeakSets - These data structures take object references as keys. Set and WeakSet represent a collection of unique values, while Map and WeakMap represent a collection of key-value associations</li>
       <li>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, derived from JavaScript, but used by many programming languages. JSON builds universal data structures that can be transferred between different environments and even across languages</li>
       <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language. This means that you can often use a value of one type where another type is expected, and the language will convert it to the right type for you</li>
       <li>The primitive coercion process is used where a primitive value is expected, but there's no strong preference for what the actual type should be. This is usually when a string, a number, or a BigInt are equally acceptable</li>
       <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true</li>
       <li>An else if statement - a 2nd condition</li>
       <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
       <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
       <li> for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
       <li>1. The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0)</li>
       <li>2. The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array</li>
       <li>3. he final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
       <li>a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name to execute it</li>
